# Dijkstra-Algorithm-for-point-and-rigid-robot

In this project we have implemented Dijkstra Algorithm to find the optimal path between 2 nodes on a given map with certain obstacles
in between like a circle, ellipse, square. rectangle and a polygon. The algorithm has been designed in such a way that the point robot and
rigid robot should not come in contact with the obstacles while exploring the path towards the goal node.


## Steps to run the program

### For running the point robot
```
python3 Dijkstra_point.py
```

### For running the rigid robot

```
python3 Dijkstra_rigid.py
```

After you run the program you will get a prompt wherein you need to input the start coordinates, goal coordinates, and radius and clearance
for the robot.
